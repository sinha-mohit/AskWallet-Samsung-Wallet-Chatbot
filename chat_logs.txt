2025-07-12 09:35:54,702 USER: what is vww?
ASSISTANT: **VWW Explanation**

VWW stands for "Verify with Samsung Wallet". It is a button that allows users to verify their identity using Samsung Wallet. 

**Implementation**

To implement the VWW button, partners need to follow a specific procedure, which includes:

1.  Inserting an "Verify with Samsung Wallet" script into their systems.
2.  Creating a card data token right after the user clicks the "Verify with Samsung Wallet" button, as the token expires in 30 seconds after creation.
3.  Using JavaScript to implement the VWW button in a web view.
4.  Downloading sample code and referring to it for implementing the VWW button in an app.

**Data Transmit Link**

The Data Transmit Link approach is a method for securely including tokenized data in the ATW link. The ATW link format for this method is as follows:

`https://a.swallet.link/vww/v1/{cardId}#Clip?cdata={cdata}`

**Button Attributes**

The VWW button has several attributes, including:

*   `type`: The service type, which is set to "vww" for Verify with Samsung Wallet.
*   `callback`: A callback function to pass the flag to proceed.
*   `partnercode`: The partner code.
*   `cardid`: The wallet card identifier issued from the Partner portal.
*   `cdata`: The actual payload data in basic JSON format to communicate between partners and Samsung Wallet, which must be secured in JWT format.

**Example Code**

Here is an example of how to implement the VWW button using JavaScript:

```javascript
onClickButton: async (options) => {
    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
        // TODO partner's process (await)
        resolve(flag)
    })
}
```

And here is an example of how to implement the VWW button using HTML:

```html
<script src="https://us-cdn-gpp.mcsvc.samsung.com/lib/wallet-card.js" type="text/javascript">
<samsung:wallet type="vww" cardid="CARD_ID" cdata="CDATA" partnercode="PARTNER_CODE" buttoni
```

**Conclusion**

In summary, VWW stands for "Verify with Samsung Wallet" and is a button that allows users to verify their identity using Samsung Wallet. Partners can implement the VWW button by following a specific procedure and using JavaScript or HTML code.

2025-07-12 09:38:21,883 USER: code for VWW button in GoLang
ASSISTANT: **Implementing VWW Button in GoLang**

Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain any information about implementing a VWW button in GoLang. However, we can infer that the Data Transmit Link approach is the most common and straightforward method for implementing a VWW button.

**Data Transmit Link Approach**

The Data Transmit Link approach securely includes tokenized data in the ATW link. The ATW link format for this method is as follows:

`https://a.swallet.link/vww/v1/{cardId}#Clip?cdata={cdata}`

Where:

* `cardId` is the wallet card identifier issued from the Partner portal.
* `cdata` is the actual payload data in basic JSON format to communicate between partners and Samsung Wallet, which must be secured in JWT (JSON Web Token) format.

**GoLang Implementation**

To implement a VWW button in GoLang, you would need to:

1. Obtain the wallet card identifier (`cardId`) from the Partner portal.
2. Create a JWT token containing the encrypted card object (`cdata`) in JSON format.
3. Construct the ATW link using the `cardId` and `cdata` values.
4. Use the `samsungWallet.addButton` function to render the Samsung Wallet API for the "Verify with Samsung Wallet" web button.

Here is a sample GoLang code snippet that demonstrates how to implement a VWW button using the Data Transmit Link approach:

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"time"

	"github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go"
)

type CardData struct {
	// Add card data fields here
}

func main() {
	// Obtain wallet card identifier from Partner portal
	cardId := "CARD_ID"

	// Create JWT token containing encrypted card object
	token := jwt.NewWithClaims(jwt.SigningMethodHS256, jwt.MapClaims{
		"exp": time.Now().Add(time.Second * 30).Unix(),
		"cdata": CardData{
			// Add card data fields here
		}.MarshalJSON(),
	})

	// Get token string
	tokenString, err := token.SignedString([]byte("SECRET_KEY"))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// Construct ATW link
	atwLink := fmt.Sprintf("https://a.swallet.link/vww/v1/%s#Clip?cdata=%s", cardId, tokenString)

	// Use samsungWallet.addButton function to render Samsung Wallet API
	samsungWallet := &SamsungWallet{}
	samsungWallet.addButton(map[string]string{
		"type":      "vww",
		"cardId":    cardId,
		"cdata":     tokenString,
		"partnerCode": "PARTNER_CODE",
		"targetId":  "TARGET_ID",
		"buttonId":  "BUTTON_ID",
		"buttonType": "btnVWSW",
		"RDClickUrl": "RD_CLICK_URL",
		"RDImpressionUrl": "RD_IMPRESSION_URL",
	})
}

type SamsungWallet struct{}

func (s *SamsungWallet) addButton(options map[string]string) {
	// Implement addButton function logic here
}
```

Note that this is a sample code snippet and may require modifications to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you will need to implement the `addButton` function logic in the `SamsungWallet` struct.
